* 1. Defining Classes
---------------------

* Introduction to classes
-------------------------
Classes were introduced with ES6 to have a better syntax for creating prototypes. 

We could create these types of objects with prototypes in the past, however, the syntax was too verbal. Therefore, the new classes were introduced with ES6. 

As a result, the new class simply inherits what prototypes are and its methods. 

It is just easier to define and use. 

Also, if any parent prototypes or classes change, all its children inherits all the changes, even after an instance of a class has been created. 


* Introduction to classes
-------------------------
. Syntactic sugar over prototypes

. Class changes get passed down

. Classes aren't hoisted

For example, if we create a class called Car, and then create an instance called SUV, and then change the main class with a C property, then its children will inherit this new property automatically, whether we want it or not. 

Classes contrary to most of its declarations aren't hoisted to the top. Therefore, classes need to be declared first if we need to use it.

We'll explore hoisting related to classes a little bit later in this course. But as a general rule, if hoisting is a bit confusing to you, try as much as possible to declare classes, objects, and variables before they are used. 

Also, there are two ways to define a class, class declaration, and class expression. 

	This is the way we define a class declaration. I will explain more on how to declare classes this way in future videos. 

	class Car {
		constructor(doors, engine, color) {
			this.doors = doors;
			this.engine = engine;
			this.color = color;
		}
	}


	const cx5 = new Car(4, 'V6', 'grey');


	This is the way we define a class expression, but more often than not, you'll see classes defined with a class declaration approach. 

	var Car = class {
		constructor(doors, engine, color) {
			this.doors = doors;
			this.engine = engine;
			this.color = color;
		}
	};


And in this course we'll use class declaration for all of the examples. 

Finally, when you define a class, you can add properties as well as functions, or called methods, in the class. I will explore this when we work with them.

* Defining a class
------------------
Now that we have some understanding of how to define a class, let's actually do this. We'll first create a base project that we can use to play with throughout this course. So let's get to it. So the first thing I'm going to do is create a folder outside here. I'm going to put it on the desktop and I'm going to right click, create a new folder, and I'm going to call this classes and then I'm going to drop it directly in VS Code. Feel free to use any editors you want but I find VS Code to be very friendly for the types of projects that we're doing, especially in this course because we're going to use an extension that we're going to get right away that's called Live Server. And it's going to allow us to always see the results of what we're doing. This one here, so actually install this one. Once it is install, all you're going to have to do is click go live when we have our project set up. So let's go ahead and set up our project. So we have our classes folder that we dropped inside of VS Code. We're going to create the first file, which is an index.html. And in this one what we're going to do is use a shortcut inside of VS Code that is simply doing doc for Doc. And then hit tab. And you're going to get most of the code that you need for your index html file. So what we're going to change here is the title of the document to JavaScript Sandbox. And then what we're going to do is literally have in our body a few things here. So we're going to have an h1 which will be the title again, JavaScript Sandbox. And then we're going to load the actual file that we're going to play with throughout. So what we're going to do is load the script source and we're going to call this app.js like so. So basically whenever we start our server right here it's going to load a JavaScript file that we're going to have in here. So let's go ahead and create that file. I'm going to save this here. And then I'm going to create a new file which will be called app.js. And just to make sure that our Go Live Server works what we're going to do is basically just do a console log. And in this console log, we're going to pass Live server works and then save this and then actually turn on our Go Live server. And right now we have the title here and let's go into our command line. So you can actually go into the three dots here, go into more tools, and go to developer tools. And I'm on Chrome or use the shortcut here. And let's go into the console. And it says here, Live server works. And also live reload is enabled. So whenever we change our code with the app.js file, we're going to see the results either in the console here or on the html if we pass it to the html. Don't worry about this one, we'll always need an icon. It doesn't have one. So this is something that you can ignore. Okay, so now let's go into VS Code again and we're going to create our first class. So let's go ahead and do that. I'm going to remove this code and I'm going to create a class called car. And this class will have a constructor. So we're constructing our class and we're passing doors to that constructor. We're passing an engine and then we're passing color. So basically what we need to build a first car, we need these things here. So basically we're going to simply create these things here, pass doors, and I'm going to repeat this for the three elements that we have in our constructor. And I'm doing Option + click to click those two. I'm going to change this to engine and then click here, Option + click, and I'm going to do color. And we're also going to create a method. So these are the properties of our class called car but also we need to have a method. So I'm going to create a method called car stats. And in this one we're going to return and I'm going to use template strings here to return. This car has, and if you're not familiar with template strings, basically it's a string but with the ability to pass on variables inside of it. So what we're going to do is do ${ we're going to pass this.doors} and then we're going to pass a, and you'll see the results when we actually create our first car with this class. This.engine and a beautiful, then again {this.color} color. So when we use this method, basically what we're going to be able to do is return a message with what we've created for the car. So now that we have our first class with our properties and our method, we can save this and then we're going to actually use it. So I'm going to create a new car called cx5 which basically needs this class car. And then for the class car, we're going to pass four doors, and we're going to pass V6 as the engine, and then we're going to pass the color gray to that first car. So now we've created a car using the class car that we just created. And now we're going to use console log to kind of get all of this somewhere in our application and our console log. So we're going to console log the cx5 and then we're going to console log as well cx5 and dot leveraging the method dots inside of the cx5 because now that we've created a new car, this method is available inside of the car that we created. It inherits basically the method that we have in a class. So we're going to use that function or method and basically return this message. Okay, so now that we have all this, we can save it. Our server will automatically update. So let's go back to here. And we have first our object or our car which has four doors, an engine V6, and the color gray which has these elements here. And obviously the car class comes from the prototype. So we have all these elements here. So we have access to the car stats, the constructor, so we can have a lot more information about this class here but we also have the method that return the message. This car has four doors, a V6, and a beautiful gray color. So as you can see, creating a class and then creating a new object from that class is fairly easy. And leverage also the functions or methods that are available inside of that class. Let's move on.
