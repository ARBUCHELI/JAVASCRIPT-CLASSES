* Introduction to mix-ins and usage
-----------------------------------
When you want to extend a class and create a new one, you can only extend one at a time. And in most cases, that will be enough. 

But sometimes, you might need to extend more than one class into a single class. 

This is where mixins are useful. As for the Gang of Four, this is one pattern where we favor composition over inheritance. 

With extends, we inherit from the parent class, with mixins, we compose into a new class. 

Some use cases could be where you implement specific methods as part of a class and others into another. And then when you need to create a new class, which will include all these methods, mixins would be your solution to do so. 

There are multiple ways to add mixins into your class, but let me demonstrate a simple way of doing so. 

Also, be wary of using mixins in your everyday life as a developer, as they sometimes add complexity, and in some communities, like React, are frowned upon. 

This is, in a way, academic. So you'll understand what they are, but use them with caution. All right. So let's go ahead and create a method at the top here. 

app.js
------
//This is a method
let mixin = {
    madeIn() {
        console.log('This car was made this year');
    } 
}

//This is the mixin itself
let carMixin = {
    __proto__: mixin,

    madeIn() {
        super.madeIn();
    }
};

class Car {
    constructor(doors, engine, color) {
        this.doors = doors;
        this.engine = engine;
        this.color = color;
    }

    carStats() {
        return `This car has ${this.doors} doors, a ${this.engine} and a beautiful ${this.color} color!`;
    }

    static totalDoors(car1, car2) {
        const doors1 = car1.doors;
        const doors2 = car2.doors;

        return doors1 + doors2;
    }
}

class SUV extends Car {
    constructor(doors, engine, color, carStats) {
        super(doors, engine, color, carStats);
        this._brand = 'No brand yet';
        this.wheels = 4;
        this.ac = true;

        // assign mixin (has to be in the constructor)
        Object.assign(this, carMixin);
    }

    get getBrand() {
        return this._brand;
    }

    set setBrand(newBrand) {
        this._brand = newBrand;
    }

    myBrand() {
        return console.log(`This SUV is a ${this.brand}`); 
    }
}

const cx5 = new SUV(4, 'V6', 'Grey');
// const civic = new Car(3, 'V4', 'Blue');

console.log(cx5.getBrand);
cx5.setBrand = 'mazda';
console.log(cx5.madeIn());


// console.log(civic);
// console.log(civic.carStats());
// console.log(Car.totalDoors(cx5, civic));
